### Overview

This may be a weird way to view writing content, but I think providing content in the simplest way has the biggest effect.

As such, I've tried to categorize things as best as I can. As I create more, I'll update each section. I hope you find something entertaining or informative.

### Git Projects

Working with Git, I am able to contribute to projects that actually need help. I tend to offer suggestions to established products and websites, but a lot of them are so large and established, my suggestions were either considered or far at the bottom of the queue. I like to follow [Code Triage](https://www.codetriage.com/) to find projects in need of my areas.

Here's a list of projects to which I've committed.
- [Comixology Ripper](https://github.com/EricPonvelle/comixology-backup): This was a fun little project where I noticed that when editing the settings of the Comixoloy DRM remover plug-in, I wasn't told anythin I did was saved. This was expected results, but I felt it created a poor experience. For my commit, I added a flag at the bottom of the screen that just says "Save" if you switch fields.
- [Awesome-SciFi List](https://github.com/EricPonvelle/awesome-scifi) - This is a fun project that's a spin-off of the [Awesome List](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome). I contributed a few items that I found interesting/

### Blog Posts

I've pared down my blog posts sinificantly to be mostly essays that I've enjoyed exploring. I think this skill helps me focus my ideas in a more cogent way while being often abstract concepts.

### Fiction

Fiction writing, while not an exemplary samples of my ability to write business content, is important to my mental health. I often write stories in my head that take time to make any sense on paper. This keeps me entertained, curious, and attempting new things all the time. Through fiction, I've found my voice, and I find these to be a really important skill I've developed.

- [Short Stories](https://github.com/EricPonvelle/shortstories) - I'm slowly porting over all my stories from Reddit. Most of my short stories are writing prompt exercises that I had some fun with; however, when I felt bold, I did some submissions to NoSleep.
- [NaNoWriMo 2018](https://github.com/EricPonvelle/nanowrimo2018) - While I self-published a book, I have never completed a NaNoWriMo until 2018. I thought this was a fun Urban Fantasy idea that stemmed from an alternate history story I never finished. I hope to edit and self-publish this soon.
- [Flash Fiction](https://github.com/EricPonvelle/pennytheater/tree/master/flashfiction) - This folder will hold the majority of my reddit writing prompts. I find the act of writing a story in a constrained manner to be very beneficial for character development.

This section includes essays, articles, and other items that I've written. I have also included some professional writing samples in here.
